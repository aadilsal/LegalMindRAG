    "query": "What are the limitations on human rights?",
    "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the limitations on human rights based on the provided context, which is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Let me start by reading through the context carefully to find any mentions of limitations.\n\nLooking at the Preamble, I see it talks about the importance of human rights and the consequences of disregarding them, but it doesn't mention limitations. Moving on to the articles, I notice Article 29. Let me read that again. \n\nArticle 29 has three points. The first point says everyone has duties to the community, which is necessary for personal development. The second point is more about limitations: it says that in exercising rights and freedoms, everyone is subject to limitations determined by law. These limitations are for respecting others' rights, morality, public order, and general welfare in a democratic society. The third point states that rights can't be exercised against the UN's purposes and principles.\n\nSo, from Article 29, it's clear that human rights are limited by law, specifically to ensure respect for others, maintain public order, and meet moral and general welfare needs. Also, rights can't be used against the UN's goals.\n\nI don't see any other articles mentioning limitations, so the main limitations are outlined in Article 29. I should make sure to include all three points from Article 29 in the answer, explaining each limitation clearly.\n</think>\n\nThe limitations on human rights, as outlined in Article 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are as follows:\n\n1. **Duties to the Community**: Everyone has duties to the community, necessary for the free and full development of their personality.\n2. **Legal Limitations**: Rights and freedoms may be subject to limitations determined by law. These are intended to secure respect for others' rights, meet moral standards, maintain public order, and ensure general welfare in a democratic society.\n3. **Prohibition Against Contrary Use**: Rights and freedoms cannot be exercised in a way that contradicts the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n\nThese points collectively define the boundaries within which human rights are exercised, ensuring a balance between individual freedoms and societal needs.",

    "query": "Which articles protect against discrimination?",
    "response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out which articles protect against discrimination based on the provided context. Let me start by going through each article one by one.\n\nFirst, I see Article 6, which talks about the right to recognition as a person before the law. That doesn't seem directly related to discrimination. Then, Article 7 states that all are equal before the law and entitled to equal protection without any discrimination. That sounds like it's about protecting against discrimination.\n\nMoving on, Article 8 is about effective remedy for acts violating rights, which is more about legal recourse. Article 9 deals with arbitrary arrest, which isn't about discrimination. Article 10 is about fair hearings, important but not specifically about discrimination. Article 11 is about the right to be presumed innocent, so that's about criminal trials, not discrimination.\n\nThen I jump to Article I, which says all humans are born free and equal in dignity. That's a broad statement against discrimination. Article 2 explicitly mentions that everyone is entitled to all rights without distinction based on race, color, sex, etc. That's definitely about protecting against discrimination.\n\nLooking at the other articles, like 23 and 24, they focus on work and rest, which don't directly address discrimination. Article 25 is about standard of living and social protection, which might touch on equality but isn't specifically about discrimination. Article 26 is about education and mentions equal access, which could be related, but it's more about education rights.\n\nSo, the articles that specifically protect against discrimination are Article 7, Article I, and Article 2. They all explicitly mention equality and protection against discrimination based on various factors.\n</think>\n\nThe articles that protect against discrimination are Article 7, Article I, and Article 2. \n\n- **Article 7** ensures equal protection under the law without discrimination.\n- **Article I** declares that all humans are born free and equal in dignity.\n- **Article 2** explicitly states that everyone is entitled to rights without distinctions based on race, color, sex, etc.\n\nThese articles collectively establish protections against various forms of discrimination.",
